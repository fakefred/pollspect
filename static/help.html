    <h2>What is Pollspect for?</h2>
    <p>
      Pollspect is a data visualization tool for Mastodon polls, added in
      v2.8.0. Pollspect automatically requests for live poll data and saves
      them, so that the snapshots can be used to generate cool graphs. Currently
      only line graphs na√Øvely denoting "how many votes, over time" are
      supported. More will come, but only with help from you. See
      &sect;Contributing.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <h3>From toot URL</h3>
    <p>
      Paste URL of a toot containing a poll, such as
      <code>https://mastodon.technology/web/statuses/103657607384494793</code>
      into the textbox on the index page.
    </p>
    <h3>From key</h3>
    <p>
      A "key" is an identifier Pollspect uses to index polls. An example is
      "mastodon.technology_21344". It consists of the instance the poll is on,
      and the poll's id provided by Mastodon's REST API (endpoint
      <code>/api/v1/polls/id</code>). A link to a poll will be provided under
      the textbox when viewing the poll, which will contain the key.
    </p>
    <h3>Pollspecting</h3>
    <p>
      Click "Pollspect". This is where it gets interesting. If the URL or key is
      correct and a poll is in there, Pollspect's backend will look for a poll
      with matching key/url. <br />If it finds one, it will give you its data. a
      line graph should appear below inside the black rectangle. The graph is in
      a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. You can save the image. <br />Else,
      the poll will be "subscribed". This means the backend will, from now on,
      acquire the poll's data at an interval. Then the data will be shown, as a
      single snapshot (x-axis) point. Remember to check out later.
    </p>
    <h3>From link</h3>
    <p>
      The link obtained from Pollspect will always stay available. Unless the
      database files are corrupted, of course.
